# DCDN - Decentralized Content Delivery Network

## 🌐 Overview
This project implements a **Decentralized Content Delivery Network (dCDN)** that distributes content across decentralized nodes rather than relying on a single centralized server. The goal is to improve **availability, scalability, fault tolerance, and resilience** while exploring modern decentralized system design.

The project demonstrates a **full-stack decentralized architecture**, combining a modern web frontend with high-performance backend logic.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Design a decentralized alternative to traditional CDNs  
- Improve content availability through distributed nodes  
- Reduce dependency on centralized infrastructure  
- Explore decentralization using modern backend and frontend technologies  
- Build an end-to-end deployable system  

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Decentralized Storage**: Files are distributed across multiple nodes for redundancy
- **Global CDN**: Worldwide network of nodes for fast content delivery
- **Privacy Controls**: Public and private file sharing options
- **Real-time Analytics**: Monitor network performance and usage statistics
- **Peer-to-Peer Network**: Direct node-to-node content distribution
- **Censorship Resistant**: Decentralized architecture prevents single points of failure

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Node.js and npm**
   ```bash
   # Download from https://nodejs.org/
   node --version  # Should be v16 or higher
   npm --version
   ```

2. **Rust and Cargo**
   ```bash
   # Install from https://rustup.rs/
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   rustc --version
   cargo --version
   ```

3. **DFINITY SDK**
   ```bash
   sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"
   dfx --version
   ```

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone or download this project**
   ```bash
   # If you have git:
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd dcdn
   
   # Or extract the downloaded files and navigate to the directory
   ```

2. **Install frontend dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Add required dependencies for ICP integration**
   ```bash
   npm install @dfinity/agent @dfinity/candid @dfinity/principal
   ```

## 🚀 Local Development

1. **Start the local development environment**
   ```bash
   # Start the frontend development server
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Deploy to local ICP replica** (in a new terminal)
   ```bash
   # Make the deploy script executable
   chmod +x deploy.sh
   
   # Run the deployment script
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

The script will:
- Start a local ICP replica
- Deploy the Rust backend canister
- Build and deploy the React frontend
- Provide you with local URLs to access your DCDN

---

## 🌍 Deploy to Mainnet

1. **Get cycles for deployment**
   - Visit https://faucet.dfinity.org/ to get free cycles for testing
   - Or purchase cycles for production deployment

2. **Deploy to Internet Computer mainnet**
   ```bash
   # Make the mainnet deploy script executable
   chmod +x deploy-mainnet.sh
   
   # Deploy to mainnet
   ./deploy-mainnet.sh
   ```

### 🔍 Explanation
- **Frontend (TypeScript / Next.js):**  
  User interface, routing, request handling, and visualization.
- **API / Gateway Layer:**  
  Routes client requests to appropriate decentralized nodes.
- **Backend (Rust):**  
  Handles core logic, performance-critical services, and decentralized coordination.
- **Decentralized Nodes / Storage:**  
  Content is stored and retrieved from distributed locations.

---
## 🧩 Technology Stack

### Frontend
- TypeScript
- React / Next.js
- CSS

### Backend
- Rust (for performance-critical services)
- Shell scripts for build and automation

### Other
- Configuration & deployment scripts
- Container / environment configuration

---

## 🔧 Usage

### Uploading Files
1. Navigate to the "Upload Files" tab
2. Drag and drop files or click to browse
3. Choose privacy settings (public/private)
4. Click "Upload to Network"

### Managing Files
1. View uploaded files in the "My Files" tab
2. Download, share, or delete files as needed
3. Copy shareable links for public files

### Monitoring Network
1. Check network statistics in the "Network Stats" tab
2. Monitor peer nodes in the "Peer Nodes" tab
3. View real-time performance metrics

---

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Cryptographic Hashing**: All files are identified by secure hashes
- **Access Control**: Private files are only accessible by owners
- **Decentralized Verification**: Network consensus for file integrity
- **Immutable Storage**: Files cannot be modified once uploaded

---

## 🌐 Network Architecture

The dCDN operates on a peer-to-peer network where:
- Multiple nodes store file replicas for redundancy
- Closest nodes serve content for optimal performance
- Automatic failover ensures high availability
- Load balancing distributes traffic efficiently

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

Track important metrics:
- **Upload/Download Statistics**: Monitor data transfer rates
- **Node Performance**: Track uptime and response times
- **Storage Utilization**: View network-wide storage usage
- **User Activity**: Analyze usage patterns

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"dfx not found" error**
   ```bash
   # Reinstall DFINITY SDK
   sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"
   ```

2. **Build failures**
   ```bash
   # Clean and rebuild
   dfx stop
   dfx start --clean --background
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

3. **Frontend not loading**
   ```bash
   # Rebuild frontend
   npm run build
   dfx deploy dcdn_frontend
   ```

4. **Cycles balance issues**
   - Visit https://faucet.dfinity.org/ for test cycles
   - Check balance: `dfx wallet --network ic balance`

## 🤝 Development Notes

- Initial project scaffolding was **AI-assisted** and later customized and extended.
- Core architectural design, integration, configuration, and customization were done manually.
- Focus was on **learning decentralized system design**, not just building a UI.

## 📊 About the Language Distribution

It shows **TypeScript as the dominant language (~92%)** because:
- The project contains a full **Next.js frontend**, which naturally has many `.ts` and `.tsx` files.
- Rust is used for **core backend logic**, which is smaller in file count but critical in functionality.
- This distribution reflects **project structure**, not importance or ownership.
